However, while <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability\">usability</a> and <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ui-design\">user interface (UI) design</a> are important aspects of UX design, they are subsets of it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 UX design covers a vast array of other areas, too. A UX designer is concerned with the <i>entire</i> process of acquiring and integrating a product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function. It is a story that begins before the device is even in the user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo product is an island. A product is more than the product. It is a cohesive, integrated set of experiences. Think through all of the stages of a product or service \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from initial intentions through final reflections, from first usage to help, service, and maintenance. Make them all work together seamlessly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d<br><br>\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Don Norman, inventor of the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUser Experience\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Products that provide great user experience (e.g., the iPhone) are thus designed with not only the product\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consumption or use in mind but also the entire process of acquiring, owning and even troubleshooting it. Similarly, UX designers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just focus on creating products that are usable; we concentrate on other aspects of the user experience, such as pleasure, efficiency and fun, too. Consequently, there is no single definition of a good user experience. Instead, a good user experience is one that meets a particular user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s needs in the specific context where he or she uses the product.\\r\\n</p><article>\\r\\n<video controls=\"\" controlslist=\"nodownload\" poster=\"https://public-media.interaction-design.org/tv/poster/7-key-factors-of-ux.jpeg\" crossorigin=\"\">\\r\\n<source src=\"/tv/course_videos/v2/7-key-factors-of-ux-720p.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\\r\\n<source src=\"/tv/course_videos/v2/7-key-factors-of-ux-480p.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\\r\\n<source src=\"/tv/course_videos/v2/7-key-factors-of-ux-480p.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\\r\\n<source src=\"/tv/course_videos/v2/7-key-factors-of-ux-720p.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n</article>\\r\\n<h2>UX Designers consider the Why, What and How of Product Use</h2>\\r\\n<p>As a UX designer, you should consider the Why, What and How of product use. The Why involves the users\\xe2\\x80\\x99 motivations for adopting a product, whether they relate to a task they wish to perform with it or to values and views which users associate with the ownership and use of the product. The What addresses the things people can do with a product\\xe2\\x80\\x94its functionality. Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way. UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with. In software designs, you will need to ensure the product\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubstance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d comes through an existing device and offers a seamless, fluid experience.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\"https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/uploads/3c7d938af5ab0d5e6ac67be9536e3c47.jpeg\">\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h2>UX Design is User-Centered</h2>\\r\\n<p>Since UX design encompasses the entire user journey, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a multidisciplinary field \\xe2\\x80\\x93 UX designers come from a variety of backgrounds such as visual design, programming, psychology and interaction design. To design for human users also means you have to work with a heightened scope regarding <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/accessibility\">accessibility</a> and accommodating many potential users\\xe2\\x80\\x99 physical limitations, such as reading small text. A UX designer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s typical tasks vary, but often include user research, creating <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/personas\">personas</a>, designing wireframes and interactive prototypes as well as testing designs. These tasks can vary greatly from one organization to the next, but they always demand designers to be the users\\xe2\\x80\\x99 advocate and keep the users\\xe2\\x80\\x99 needs at the center of <i>all</i> design and development efforts. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also why most UX designers work in some form of user-centered work process, and keep channeling their best-informed efforts until they address all of the relevant issues and user needs optimally.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\"https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/uploads/c37b39f3cdb056c824200d8e12a8de1b.png\"><br>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><i><i><a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design\">User-centered design</a></i> is an iterative process where you take an understanding of the users and their context as a starting point for all design and development.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h2>Learn More about UX Design</h2>\\r\\n<p>You can read and watch more about UX design from the inventor of the term, Don Norman, right here:<a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/author/don-norman/\">https://www.nngroup.com/articles/author/don-norman/</a>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>Medium.com has a wealth of insightful, funny and inspiring material on UX.

Design</h2>\\n\\n            <p>If there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an occupation that is 100% linked with the public\\xe2\\x80\\x99s idea of what design is all about, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s graphic design. From the familiar golden arches of the McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brand to the typography and colors of movie posters, graphic designers create some of the most iconic and ubiquitous designs around us. So why would a graphic designer like you want to change your career to UX design? Well, for one, much can be said about the sense of satisfaction and fulfillment derived from getting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunder the hood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the products you work on rather than working on the exterior. Furthermore, according to PayScale, the average salary for a graphic designer in the United States is $41,000(1), but the same for a UX designer is a whopping $74,000(2).Whatever the reason for the move, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear that it can be a very rewarding one. But how do you go about switching from graphic design to UX design? Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s find out.</p><p>The user experience (UX) is what a user of a particular product experiences when using that product.  A UX designer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job is thus to create a product that provides the best possible user experience. How does that happen?</p>\\n\\n            <div data-toggle-content id=\"full-article-content\">\\n                <!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html><body>  <h1>What is User Experience and User Experience Design?</h1>    <p>Well, it starts with a lot of research. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t create anything of value to a user unless you understand what kind of problems they want to solve and how you can solve those problems, so that the user will want\\xe2\\x80\\x94or better still, need\\xe2\\x80\\x94your solution. You can only get that understanding by interacting with users.</p>  <p>UX designers tend to be concerned with, as you can see from the image below, 3 primary factors: the look of a product, the feel of that product and the usability of that product.</p><p><img src=\"https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/uploads/9153fdf2373a09b5a3d95cc4e68a966f.gif\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><span></span></p>  <p>The look of a product is all about creating a product that has visual appeal and which, in particular, harmonizes with a user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s values and captures the spirit of what they expect in that product. In other words, it has to not only look nice, but look right too. In doing so, it establishes a bond of trust and credibility between the product and the user.</p>  <p>Next is the feel, which is really about developing products that are \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca joy to use\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. That is, whether you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re interacting with them or reacting to them, products should provide a pleasurable experience and not just a functional one.</p>  <p>Lastly, usability is the cornerstone of user experience. If a product isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t usable, the experience of using it can never be good. UX designers want to create products which can, ideally, be tailored to meet a user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s specific needs, but which provides functionality that is predictable.</p>  <p>If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still unsure of what UX design is all about, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry! We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a series of articles which may help you make up your mind\\xe2\\x80\\x94they examine some of the high-level key concepts of UX design in a bit more detail than we can here:</p>  <p><a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/5-things-everyone-should-know-about-ux-work\">5 Things Everyone Should Know About UX Work</a></p>  <p><a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/an-introduction-to-usability\">An Introduction to Usability</a></p>  <p><a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/key-question-in-user-experience-design-usability-vs-desirability\">Usability vs Desirability</a></p>  <p><a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-interaction-design\">What is Interaction Design?</a></p>    <h2>What Do Graphic Design and UX Design Have in Common?</h2><p><img src=\"https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/uploads/7b9d726df9d9b4bfcadc5c4c00771fce.jpg\"></p><h3>Emotional Design<br></h3>  <p>Graphic design is about emotional communication through typography, color and images; serif fonts and dark, duller colors evoke seriousness, while san-serif fonts and bright colors tend to bring out a sense of joy or excitement. Graphic designers are hence very often emotional designers who elicit specific reactions in a user. UX design is also concerned with shaping the emotions of the user, although it tends to take a broader, big picture view of the entire user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience with the product. On top of focusing on the right typography and colors, UX designers are also concerned with motion design, the tone of the content, and information architecture, among others.</p>  <h3>Creative thinking</h3>  <p>Graphic designers and UX designers are both equally skilled at creative thinking. For graphic designers, creating visuals that adhere to conventions (and thus communicate effectively) while retaining a sense of originality (to stand out among the competition) requires some serious creative and critical thinking. In the same way, UX designers have to create products that solve users\\xe2\\x80\\x99 problems\\xe2\\x80\\x94and sometimes, conventional solutions aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always the best or most appropriate ones.</p>  <h3>Prototyping</h3>  <p>Graphic designers often create mockups and wireframes of their designs prior to delivering a finished design. It gives a chance for clients to offer feedback on their designs and for them to improve them without having to start from scratch. UX designers create mockups and prototypes too, but these tend to be less focused on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9clook\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the product and more on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfeel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of it. Is the prototype useful? Is it usable? Is it desirable? These are the questions a UX designer wants answers to.</p>  <h2>The Differences between Graphic Design and UX Design</h2>  <h3>User-focused vs pixel-focused</h3>  <p>Graphic designers tend to pursue pixel perfection in their designs. Ensuring that texts have perfect kerning and colors conform to brand guidelines often take up a significant portion of graphic designers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 jobs\\xe2\\x80\\x94and for good reason, too. UX designers, however, are primarily focused on users. They study the interface between users and the product, finding ways to ensure that the product answers to the user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s key needs. And they do so by conducting a lot of research\\xe2\\x80\\x94by talking to and observing users, creating user personas and stories, doing usability testing on the products, and many more. Graphic designers looking to switch career tracks will need to do a substantial amount of work finding out how to conduct user research (more about this a bit later on in the article).</p>  <h3>Iterative problem solving</h3>  <p>UX design is very much an iterative problem solving process, and it can be very different from what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re used to doing as a graphic designer. It begins with the identification of a problem; this is often found through user research, and if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not, it will then be confirmed through user research. There is no point in solving problems that users don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about; they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay to solve those problems, and that means your company won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make money.</p><p><img src=\"https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/uploads/230e3eb882eb8379887eeef3b553a4f0.jpg\"><br></p><p>From the problem identification stage, more research is conducted into how best to solve the problem in a way that the user will be happy with\\xe2\\x80\\x94usually via observations, surveys, ethnographic studies, etc.</p>  <p>This research then informs the product\\xe2\\x80\\x99s design. Designs are then tested with users to see if the research led to the right solutions. The designs are constantly iterated until research confirms that they are good enough. </p>  <p>Once this happens the product is launched, but the design process is not over. The design will be continually tested and user feedback will be taken, thus beginning a new round of user research. Future improvements to the design will be made based on this feedback. </p>  <h3>Multi-disciplinary vs specialized</h3>  <p>Graphic design is a specialized discipline, and there is a certain level of craftsmanship and set of specialized skills (such as typography and color theory) required to produce great visuals. UX design, on the other hand, is much more multi-disciplinary and involves many schools of knowledge. UX designers have to constantly learn about human psychology, interaction design, information architecture and user research techniques, just to name a few, in order to create the right solutions to a user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problems. Don Norman, the man who coined the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUser Experience\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, explains that user experience covers \\xe2\\x80\\x9call aspects of the person\\'s experience with the system including industrial design graphics, the interface, the physical interaction and the manual.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>  <h2>The Big Benefit of Graphic Design Experience when Moving to UX Design</h2>  <h3>Aesthetics</h3>  <p>The biggest benefit for graphic designers moving to UX design is that they can make things attractive. A very common misconception about UX design is that good usability trumps aesthetics. On the contrary, good aesthetics have been found to improve the overall user experience of product\\xe2\\x80\\x94by making users more relaxed, creating a positive first impression, and generally just showing that you care<sup>(3)</sup>.</p><p><img src=\"https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/uploads/4ca5dae83d9262f51f85a242a8bdd3f1.png\"></p><p>Aesthetics also help designers communicate with the internal stakeholders in their companies. Ex-graphic designers can present research results in a way that makes stakeholders sit up and really take notice. Graphic design skills are often thought of as optional in UX research, but it would be hard to deny the impact of well-presented beautiful findings. If you do make the change, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to balance your tendency to make things gorgeous with the need for moving your design projects forward. There are times in UX design when a few scribbles on the back of a napkin are more than enough to get things going; don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spend 3 days producing a poster when this is the case.</p>  <h3>Conventions and trends</h3>  <p>Coming from a design background not only means having a good grip on design terminology, but also that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re likely to be familiar with the conventions and trends in web or app designs. Most times, UX designers make use of standardized conventions (like a toggle switch for on/off states, dropdown list for multiple options, etc.) because users have come to expect these interactions on a website. Graphic designers\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve created prototypes in the past\\xe2\\x80\\x94are also familiar with such conventions. That means you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll adapt more quickly to a UX design role than someone who comes from a non-design background. This might not sound like much, but communication is the core of any UX design project and being able to talk-the-talk is a big benefit. </p>  <h1>How to Enhance Your Skills to Make the Jump from Graphic Design to UX Design</h1>  <p>Is there a gap between graphic design skills and UX design skills? Yes, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not an insurmountable one. Graphic designers already speak the language of design; they just need to brush up their skills to include those that are unique to UX design. </p>  <p>Once you have those skills, you can start to work them into your graphic design work (because user experience design can inform graphic design just as much as it can inform product design) and start to tailor your CV to highlight your UX skills as well as your graphic design skills. </p>  <p>As we mentioned above, the real key for graphic designers is to understand user research in all its forms. All the courses we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve highlighted below should address this need to a greater extent.</p>  <h2>Online Courses</h2>  <h3>Interaction Design Foundation</h3>  <p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to modestly present our own course offerings for this, as the <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/why-join-idf\">Interaction Design Foundation</a> is the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest specialist design education community. Don Norman, the same man who coined the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUser Experience\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and who is one of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best known designers, says that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca goldmine of information on interaction design\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; Forbes magazine says we supply an Ivy League level of UX design education! </p>  <p>There are three courses that we have put together specifically with a career change or first job in UX design in mind. In <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/courses/become-a-ux-designer-from-scratch\">Become a UX Designer from Scratch</a>, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be introduced to all areas of UX work, learn basic practical skills to conduct UX work, and gain the confidence to work with UX clients as a consultant. In <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/courses/get-your-first-job-as-a-ux-or-interaction-designer\">Get Your First Job as a UX (or Interaction) Designer</a>, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find out how to get the experience in UX that prospective employers are looking for, learn to develop a winning cover letter, CV and portfolio to get a UX interview, and negotiate a job offer. And in <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/courses/user-research-methods-and-best-practices\">User Research \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Methods and Best Practices</a>, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll learn the various methods of conducting user research, and then putting the research results into action.</p>  <p>We also offer a bunch of other courses (32, and constantly growing!) to help you further develop your skills in UX design. The good news is that with a low annual fee, you get access to all of our courses for a year with no additional charges, and you get access to our community too. </p>  <p>You can find out about our other courses <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/courses\">here</a>.</p>  <h3>Coursera</h3>  <p>You might also want to try the folks at <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\">Coursera.org</a>, which is a low cost but high quality education provider which delivers courses on a wide range of subjects including UX. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s run by a consortium of universities and courses are generally very good. While all their courses used to be free (which was excellent value) they currently charge by the course for most programs. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also worth noting that their courses are only available infrequently (at most once or twice a year).</p>  <h3>Udemy</h3>  <p><a href=\"http://www.udemy.com/\">Udemy</a> is the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest broker of training. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t design their own training; rather, they enable course creators to sell their courses on their platform. They offer literally thousands of courses in almost any conceivable subject. The trouble is that Udemy provides no quality control, and while you can find some great courses there, there are a lot of not so great courses too.</p>  <h2>Classroom Courses</h2>  <h3>Nielsen Norman Group</h3>  <p>If you have deeper pockets and would prefer to learn in a classroom than learn online, then you might want to check out the classroom courses offered by the <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/courses/ux-basic-training/\">Nielsen Norman Group</a>. The group has an excellent reputation and is one of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most respected UX consultancies. They offer their courses in a range of locations, but we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t guarantee that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find one on your doorstep and you may have to travel some distance to take part in them.</p>  <h3>Cooper</h3>  <p>We also think that <a href=\"http://www.cooper.com/training/\">Cooper.com</a> has a great reputation for providing classroom training for UX design. Once again, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not cheap but that is always going to be true of professional classroom training. They do, however, also offer a wide range of locations for delivering their courses and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s useful for those looking to minimize travel.</p>  <h2>University Courses</h2>  <p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sure that university is the best option for those seeking a change of career direction; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just the money required, but also the time taken. You could be earning and learning using a different method rather than spending 3 or 4 years on a bachelor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree or 2 years on a Master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s program. However, if you do decide to go the university route, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll want to spend a lot of time researching exactly the right program for you. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a couple of examples for you here but there are literally hundreds of programs globally and we couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hope to cover them all.</p>  <p>Carnegie Mellon \\xe2\\x80\\x93 <a href=\"http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/hci-undergraduate\">HCI Programs</a> </p>  <p>York University \\xe2\\x80\\x93 <a href=\"https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught-courses/msc-hcit/\">MSc in HCI Technologies</a></p>  <p>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d urge that you sit down with a calculator and think about the costs associated with going to university before booking a place. HSBC, as reported by Top Universities, found that the average US university course will cost you $36,564 a year (including rent, tuition, books, etc.).<sup> (4)</sup> Over a 4-year degree, that means shelling out a cool $146,256\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s without the costs of a loan to cover those expenses.</p>  <p>But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not all\\xe2\\x80\\x94you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll also have to give up full-time work. According to the US Census Bureau, a non-graduate earns an average of $27,351 per year.<sup>(5)</sup> This gives us a 4-year opportunity cost (that is, the income that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve forgone while in university) of $109,404. That means 4 years at university will set you back a huge $255,660!</p><p><img src=\"https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/uploads/85346f84eb78464dda150822920d4896.jpg\"></p>  <p>If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know which kind of learning to invest in, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s OK. We know it can be confusing trying to work out what will add the most value to your career. With that in mind, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve put together a piece that walks you through calculating the Return on Investment in learning <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-calculate-the-return-on-investment-of-a-design-education\">here</a>; hopefully that will help you decide what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right for you. </p>  <h2>Networking</h2>  <p>Once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve brushed up your skillset and you feel you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ready for that first UX role, you might find handy to do some networking. The best opportunities are almost always found when someone already in the field recommends you for a position. One of the best places to start with your networking is <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a>. Join some UX groups, start contributing, and build that all important network with your peers. But take it slow; don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just show up and start asking for a job. You need relationships with people before they will help.</p>  <p>We also offer some awesome networking opportunities to both our members and non-members too. Members can join our global community of UX professionals in the many <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/discuss\">discussion groups and forums</a> that we provide; we have the largest specialist design community on earth so there are plenty of opportunities to be uncovered there. For members and non-members, we also have local group meetings in many places around the planet. These meetings are completely free to attend and are a great way to meet people doing UX in your home town or city. Find out more at our <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/community\">Community page</a>. </p>  <p>One other useful way to start networking is to follow famous members of the UX design community on Twitter. Not only will you learn a lot from them, you can also interact with their followers (who are likely to be designers like you too). We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve put together a list of twenty people you should follow on Twitter in the UX sphere <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/20-people-in-ux-that-you-have-to-follow-on-twitter\">here</a> to get your started.</p><p><img src=\"https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/uploads/ec997b40e33f62b1774a1421fa9ae950.jpeg\"></p>  <h2>Mentoring and Feedback</h2>  <p>Another great way to develop your career is to work with a mentor in the UX field who has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeen there, done it and bought the t-shirt\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, at least so to speak. You may find a mentor through your own network nd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an awesome way to connect with a mentor, but if you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t then our <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/design-league\">IDF Design League</a> members can access our network of design mentors as part of their annual membership fee. <u></u></p>  <h2>The Take Away</h2>  <p>If you want to change from graphic design to UX design as a career, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s awesome. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to be as difficult as you might think either. You just need to get a little training under your belt so that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re familiar with what it is a UX designer does, and then you can put some of those techniques to work in your current role. Then when you think the time is right, you can start networking and lining up some interviews for your new job!</p>  <h2>References & Where to Learn More</h2>  <ol><li>Payscale\\xe2\\x80\\x99s

2005, and according to tech research firm Gartner, <strong>the focus on digital experience is no longer limited to digital-born companies any more.</strong> Chances are, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard of the term, or even have it on your portfolio. But, like most of us, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a good chance that you sometimes feel unsure of what the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuser experience\\xe2\\x80\\x9d actually covers.\\r\\n</p><blockquote>[User experience] is used by people to say, <i>\\xe2\\x80\\x98</i><i>I</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x99</i><i>m a user experience designer, I design websites</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x99</i><i>, or </i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x98</i><i>I design apps.</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x99</i><i> [</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\xa6</i><i>] and they think the experience is that simple device, the website, or the app, or who knows what. No! It</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x99</i><i>s everything</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x94</i><i>it</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x99</i><i>s the way you experience the world, it</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x99</i><i>s the way you experience your life, it</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x99</i><i>s the way you experience the service. Or, yeah, an app or a computer system. But it</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x99</i><i>s a <strong>system</strong> that</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x99</i><i>s everything.</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</i><br><br>\\t<i>\\xe2\\x80\\x94</i><i> Don Norman, pioneer and inventor of the term </i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x9c</i><i>user experience</i><i>\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, in an interview with NNGroup</i></blockquote><p>As indicated by Don Norman, <strong>User Experience is an umbrella term that covers a number of different areas</strong>. When you work with user experience, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crucial to have a good understanding of what those areas are so that you know what tools are available to you.\\r\\n</p><p>Throughout this course, you will <strong>gain a thorough understanding of the various design principles that come together to create a user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience when using a product or service</strong>. As you proceed, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll learn the value user experience design brings to a project, and what areas you must consider when you want to design great user experiences. Because user experience is an evolving term, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give you a definition of \\xe2\\x80\\x98user experience\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to end all discussions, but we will provide you with a solid understanding of the different aspects of user experience, so it becomes clear in your mind what is involved in creating great UX designs.\\r\\n</p><p><strong>If you are new to the Interaction Design Foundation, this course is a great place to start</strong> because it brings together materials from many of our other courses. This provides you with both an excellent introduction to user experience and with a preview of the courses we have to offer to help you develop your future career. After each lesson, we will introduce you to the courses you can take if a specific topic has caught your attention. That way, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find it easy to continue your learning journey.</p>\\n                        </div>\\n                    </div>\\n                </div>\\n                    \\n        <h2 class=\"heading heading--subSectionHeading\">\\n            All literature\\n        </h2>\\n\\n                    <form action=\"/literature/topics/ux-design?page=1\"\\n                  method=\"GET\">\\n                <div class=\"form form--inline form--centered\">\\n                    <label for=\"order_articles_by\" class=\"cols-sm-2 as-plain-text\">Order literature by:</label>\\n                    <select name=\"order_by\" id=\"order_articles_by\" style=\"min-width: 250px;\">\\n                        <option value=\"popularity\" selected>\\n                            Most shared in this topic\\n                        </option>\\n                        <option value=\"date\" >\\n                            Latest UX literature in this topic\\n                        </option>\\n                    </select>\\n                </div>\\n            </form>\\n        \\n        <div class=\"wrapper col-md-2 out-top-none\">\\n                                                <a href=\"/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/human-computer-interaction-brief-intro\" title=\"Human Computer Interaction - brief intro\">\\n    <div class=\"card js-card card--bookChapter card--mediumBookChapter\"\\n         data-book-id=\"120714\" data-book-chapter-id=\"35313\">\\n\\n        <div class=\"card__inner\">\\n            <div class=\"card__header\" data-title=\"Read book chapter\">\\n                <img src=\"https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/idf-lazy-placeholder.png\"\\n                     data-src=\"https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/book-covers/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed.png\"\\n                     alt=\"Human Computer Interaction - brief intro\">\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\"card__contents\">\\n                <h2 class=\"card__title js-cardTitle\">Ch 2: Human Computer Interaction - brief intro</h2>\\n                <p class=\"card__copy truncate-2\">\\n                    Human-computer interaction (HCI) is an area of research and practice that emerged in the early 1980s, initially as a specialty area in computer science embracing cognitive science and human factors engineering.

       " 'This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.\\rLearn about the history of UX and what it means to be a UX designer here.What UX Designers do goes Beyond UI Design“User Experience Design” is often used interchangeably with terms such as “User Interface Design” and “Usability”',\n",
       " 'However, while usability and user interface (UI) design are important aspects of UX design, they are subsets of it – UX design covers a vast array of other areas, too',\n",
       " 'A UX designer is concerned with the entire process of acquiring and integrating a product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function',\n",
       " 'It is a story that begins before the device is even in the user’s hands.\\r“No product is an island',\n",
       " 'A product is more than the product',\n",
       " 'It is a cohesive, integrated set of experiences',\n",
       " 'Think through all of the stages of a product or service – from initial intentions through final reflections, from first usage to help, service, and maintenance',\n",
       " 'Make them all work together seamlessly.”— Don Norman, inventor of the term “User Experience”\\rProducts that provide great user experience (e.g., the iPhone) are thus designed with not only the product’s consumption or use in mind but also the entire process of acquiring, owning and even troubleshooting it',\n",
       " 'Similarly, UX designers don’t just focus on creating products that are usable; we concentrate on other aspects of the user experience, such as pleasure, efficiency and fun, too',\n",
       " 'Consequently, there is no single definition of a good user experience',\n",
       " 'Instead, a good user experience is one that meets a particular user’s needs in the specific context where he or she uses the product.\\rUX Designers consider the Why, What and How of Product UseAs a UX designer, you should consider the Why, What and How of product use',\n",
       " 'The Why involves the users’ motivations for adopting a product, whether they relate to a task they wish to perform with it or to values and views which users associate with the ownership and use of the product',\n",
       " 'The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality',\n",
       " 'Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way',\n",
       " 'UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with',\n",
       " 'In software designs, you will need to ensure the product’s “substance” comes through an existing device and offers a seamless, fluid experience.\\rUX Design is User-CenteredSince UX design encompasses the entire user journey, it’s a multidisciplinary field – UX designers come from a variety of backgrounds such as visual design, programming, psychology and interaction design',\n",
       " 'To design for human users also means you have to work with a heightened scope regarding accessibility and accommodating many potential users’ physical limitations, such as reading small text',\n",
       " 'A UX designer’s typical tasks vary, but often include user research, creating personas, designing wireframes and interactive prototypes as well as testing designs',\n",
       " 'These tasks can vary greatly from one organization to the next, but they always demand designers to be the users’ advocate and keep the users’ needs at the center of all design and development efforts',\n",
       " 'That’s also why most UX designers work in some form of user-centered work process, and keep channeling their best-informed efforts until they address all of the relevant issues and user needs optimally.\\rUser-centered design is an iterative process where you take an understanding of the users and their context as a starting point for all design and development.Learn More about UX DesignYou can read and watch more about UX design from the inventor of the term, Don Norman, right here:https://www.nngroup.com/articles/author/don-norman/Medium.com has a wealth of insightful, funny and inspiring material on UX',\n",

       " 'From the familiar golden arches of the McDonald’s brand to the typography and colors of movie posters, graphic designers create some of the most iconic and ubiquitous designs around us',\n",
       " 'So why would a graphic designer like you want to change your career to UX design? Well, for one, much can be said about the sense of satisfaction and fulfillment derived from getting “under the hood” of the products you work on rather than working on the exterior',\n",

       " ' A UX designer’s job is thus to create a product that provides the best possible user experience',\n",
       " 'How does that happen? What is User Experience and User Experience Design? Well, it starts with a lot of research',\n",
       " 'You can’t create anything of value to a user unless you understand what kind of problems they want to solve and how you can solve those problems, so that the user will want—or better still, need—your solution',\n",
       " 'You can only get that understanding by interacting with users',\n",
       " 'UX designers tend to be concerned with, as you can see from the image below, 3 primary factors: the look of a product, the feel of that product and the usability of that product',\n",
       " 'The look of a product is all about creating a product that has visual appeal and which, in particular, harmonizes with a user’s values and captures the spirit of what they expect in that product',\n",
       " 'In other words, it has to not only look nice, but look right too',\n",
       " 'In doing so, it establishes a bond of trust and credibility between the product and the user',\n",
       " 'Next is the feel, which is really about developing products that are “a joy to use”',\n",
       " 'That is, whether you’re interacting with them or reacting to them, products should provide a pleasurable experience and not just a functional one',\n",
       " 'Lastly, usability is the cornerstone of user experience',\n",
       " 'If a product isn’t usable, the experience of using it can never be good',\n",
       " 'UX designers want to create products which can, ideally, be tailored to meet a user’s specific needs, but which provides functionality that is predictable',\n",

We’ve got a series of articles which may help you make up your mind—they examine some of the high-level key concepts of UX design in a bit more detail than we can here: 5 Things Everyone Should Know About UX Work An Introduction to Usability Usability vs Desirability What is Interaction Design? What Do Graphic Design and UX Design Have in Common?Emotional Design Graphic design is about emotional communication through typography, color and images; serif fonts and dark, duller colors evoke seriousness, while san-serif fonts and bright colors tend to bring out a sense of joy or excitement',\n",
       " 'Graphic designers are hence very often emotional designers who elicit specific reactions in a user',\n",
       " 'UX design is also concerned with shaping the emotions of the user, although it tends to take a broader, big picture view of the entire user’s experience with the product',\n",
       " 'On top of focusing on the right typography and colors, UX designers are also concerned with motion design, the tone of the content, and information architecture, among others',\n",
       " 'Creative thinking Graphic designers and UX designers are both equally skilled at creative thinking',\n",
       " 'For graphic designers, creating visuals that adhere to conventions (and thus communicate effectively) while retaining a sense of originality (to stand out among the competition) requires some serious creative and critical thinking',\n",
       " 'In the same way, UX designers have to create products that solve users’ problems—and sometimes, conventional solutions aren’t always the best or most appropriate ones',\n",
       " 'Prototyping Graphic designers often create mockups and wireframes of their designs prior to delivering a finished design',\n",
       " 'It gives a chance for clients to offer feedback on their designs and for them to improve them without having to start from scratch',\n",
       " 'UX designers create mockups and prototypes too, but these tend to be less focused on the “look” of the product and more on the “feel” of it',\n",
       " 'Is the prototype useful? Is it usable? Is it desirable? These are the questions a UX designer wants answers to',\n",
       " 'The Differences between Graphic Design and UX Design User-focused vs pixel-focused Graphic designers tend to pursue pixel perfection in their designs',\n",
       " 'Ensuring that texts have perfect kerning and colors conform to brand guidelines often take up a significant portion of graphic designers’ jobs—and for good reason, too',\n",
       " 'UX designers, however, are primarily focused on users',\n",
       " 'They study the interface between users and the product, finding ways to ensure that the product answers to the user’s key needs',\n",
       " 'And they do so by conducting a lot of research—by talking to and observing users, creating user personas and stories, doing usability testing on the products, and many more',\n",
       " 'Graphic designers looking to switch career tracks will need to do a substantial amount of work finding out how to conduct user research (more about this a bit later on in the article)',\n",
       " 'Iterative problem solving UX design is very much an iterative problem solving process, and it can be very different from what you’re used to doing as a graphic designer',\n",
       " 'It begins with the identification of a problem; this is often found through user research, and if it’s not, it will then be confirmed through user research',\n",
       " 'There is no point in solving problems that users don’t care about; they won’t pay to solve those problems, and that means your company won’t make money.From the problem identification stage, more research is conducted into how best to solve the problem in a way that the user will be happy with—usually via observations, surveys, ethnographic studies, etc',\n",
       " 'This research then informs the product’s design',\n",
       " 'Designs are then tested with users to see if the research led to the right solutions',\n",
       " 'The designs are constantly iterated until research confirms that they are good enough',\n",
       " ' Once this happens the product is launched, but the design process is not over',\n",
       " 'The design will be continually tested and user feedback will be taken, thus beginning a new round of user research',\n",
       " 'Future improvements to the design will be made based on this feedback',\n",
       " ' Multi-disciplinary vs specialized Graphic design is a specialized discipline, and there is a certain level of craftsmanship and set of specialized skills (such as typography and color theory) required to produce great visuals',\n",
       " 'UX design, on the other hand, is much more multi-disciplinary and involves many schools of knowledge',\n",
       " 'UX designers have to constantly learn about human psychology, interaction design, information architecture and user research techniques, just to name a few, in order to create the right solutions to a user’s problems',\n",

       " 'A very common misconception about UX design is that good usability trumps aesthetics',\n",
       " 'On the contrary, good aesthetics have been found to improve the overall user experience of product—by making users more relaxed, creating a positive first impression, and generally just showing that you care(3).Aesthetics also help designers communicate with the internal stakeholders in their companies',\n",
       " 'Ex-graphic designers can present research results in a way that makes stakeholders sit up and really take notice',\n",
       " 'Graphic design skills are often thought of as optional in UX research, but it would be hard to deny the impact of well-presented beautiful findings',\n",
       " 'If you do make the change, you’ll need to balance your tendency to make things gorgeous with the need for moving your design projects forward',\n",
       " 'There are times in UX design when a few scribbles on the back of a napkin are more than enough to get things going; don’t spend 3 days producing a poster when this is the case',\n",
       " 'Conventions and trends Coming from a design background not only means having a good grip on design terminology, but also that you’re likely to be familiar with the conventions and trends in web or app designs',\n",
       " 'Most times, UX designers make use of standardized conventions (like a toggle switch for on/off states, dropdown list for multiple options, etc.) because users have come to expect these interactions on a website',\n",
       " 'Graphic designers—especially if you’ve created prototypes in the past—are also familiar with such conventions',\n",
       " 'That means you’ll adapt more quickly to a UX design role than someone who comes from a non-design background',\n",
       " 'This might not sound like much, but communication is the core of any UX design project and being able to talk-the-talk is a big benefit',\n",
       " ' How to Enhance Your Skills to Make the Jump from Graphic Design to UX Design Is there a gap between graphic design skills and UX design skills? Yes, but it’s not an insurmountable one',\n",
       " 'Graphic designers already speak the language of design; they just need to brush up their skills to include those that are unique to UX design',\n",
       " ' Once you have those skills, you can start to work them into your graphic design work (because user experience design can inform graphic design just as much as it can inform product design) and start to tailor your CV to highlight your UX skills as well as your graphic design skills',\n",
